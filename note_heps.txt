1.Introduction to ISC DHCP
The ISC DHCP package contains both the client and server programs for DHCP. dhclient (the client) is used for connecting to a network which uses DHCP to assign network addresses. dhcpd (the server) is used for assigning network addresses on private networks.

2.Short Descriptions
dhclient is the implementation of the DHCP client.
dhclient-script is used by dhclient to (re)configure interfaces. It can make extra changes by invoking custom dhclient-{entry,exit}-hooks.
dhcpd implements Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) requests for network addresses.
